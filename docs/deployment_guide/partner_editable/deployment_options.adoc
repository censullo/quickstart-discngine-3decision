This Quick Start provides two deployment options:

* https://fwd.aws/PKJJ8?[Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into a new VPC]. This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, bastion hosts, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys {partner-product-short-name} into this new VPC.
* https://fwd.aws/jdzqY?[Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into an existing VPC]. This option provisions {partner-product-short-name} in an existing VPC. This VPC does not need to have public subnets but does require internet access.
* https://fwd.aws/37qRp?[Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into an existing VPC and existing EKS cluster]. This option provisions {partner-product-short-name} in your existing AWS infrastructure.

The Quick Start provides separate templates for these options. It also lets you configure Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks, instance types, and {partner-product-short-name} settings.
