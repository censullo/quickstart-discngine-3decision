image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans three Availability Zones.*
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.
** Linux bastion hosts in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound SSH (Secure Shell) access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in public and private subnets.
* In the private subnets, Kubernetes nodes in an Auto Scaling group to set up 3decision software.
* Amazon Elastic Load Balancing for the 3decision application and extract, transform, and load (ETL) configuration panel.
* Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) for Kubernetes orchestration of the EKS cluster of 3decision nodes.
* Amazon Elastic Block Storage (Amazon EBS) for persistent storage of Kubernetes data.
* Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) for 3decision data and analysis.
* Amazon Route 53 for a Domain Name System (DNS) record.
